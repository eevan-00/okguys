	<p>
	Yes! <br>
	According to Teresa Manucy, DVM, a veterinarian at VCA Fleming Island Animal Hospital, cats can recognize and differentiate their name from other household pets’ names. She says this recognition is likely due to positive reinforcement or a cat’s association of their name with attention, food, or play.
